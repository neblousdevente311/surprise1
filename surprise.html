            <p>somewhere between the softest<br>
            of your breaths and <br>
            the moon that leans <br>
            to listen (i have <br>
            discovered) a million tiny <br>
            reasons why <br>
            i love you<br>
            <br>
            (i love you more than words have colors<br>
            more than mornings have newness <br>
            more than sunsets feel like honey <br>
            or the oceans have secrets <br>
            that whisper only to you)<br>
            <br>
            and when you laugh—oh! <br>
            the world tilts a little closer <br>
            to perfection<br>
            <br>
            if i were a tree, you’d be the earth <br>
            i’d root myself so deeply in <br>
            your gentle warmth <br>
            your every smile is a sun <br>
            that makes me grow taller into <br>
            whoever i am meant to be<br>
            <br>
            (i would ask the stars to wait a lifetime <br>
            just to see your face one more time)<br>
            <br>
            and though i may not ask <br>
            the question straight, love <br>
            in all the silences <br>
            between our words, know this:<br>
            there is a forever <br>
            that waits <br>
            in every heartbeat<br>
            and in every heartbeat <br>
            is a whisper <br>
            (yours alone)<br>
            <br>
            if the moon ever said “marry me,” <br>
            i think i’d say yes <br>
            <br>
            because you are my moon—<br>
            the loveliest i have ever known<br>
            </p>
